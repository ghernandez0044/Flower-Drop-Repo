# Project Scope Statement

## Project Overview

FlowerDrop is at its fundamentals, an e-commerce platform for a floral business combined with features and functionalities that are most valued by customers when using an e-commerce platform for their floral purchases. Factors such as convenience, wider product selection, and the ability to compare prices easily are what is going to be driving the development of our our MVP features such as flowers search+results, bouquet search+result, individual flower/bouquet information page, filter and search based on prices to allow the easy comparison, and implementing an optimized and efficient experience both in desktop and mobile browser to offer the convenience.
